1. A good place to start. Tutorials point [tut](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/javascript/index.htm)
2. These video tutorials to go with:
    + 1 hour tutorial. Listen and follow along. [Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fju9ii8YsGs)
    + 9 Part tutorial (same author). Again, listen and follow along. [Link](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLBA965A22D89CF13B)

Those were the basics, now for the fun part. Get familiar with these libraries for interactive visualizations with JS. 
  + Bootstrap: For reactive webpages
    - [Video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqOEoUR5RHg). Warning! This video covers a lot of material. I advice you pause and implement as you go. 

Ok these two are for Data Visualization. A bit advanced, but do learn some samples. They'll go a long way. 
  + D3JS: A data visualizer -> https://d3js.org/
  + Interactive charts with Crossfilter -> http://square.github.io/crossfilter/

Finally, since you now know Python. Check out [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/). Flask lets you combine HTML and JS with Python to create amazing webpages. With these tools, you can now create an entire framework front-to-back. 
    + This [tutorial](http://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/the-flask-mega-tutorial-part-i-hello-world) will teach you flask. It's long, but **very** useful!

As an exercise do follow [**this**](https://realpython.com/blog/python/web-development-with-flask-fetching-data-with-requests/) guide. It combines Flask, JS, and D3 to create an Webpage that visualizes REAL DATA.
